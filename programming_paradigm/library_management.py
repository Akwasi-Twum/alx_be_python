Objective: Solidify understanding of basic OOP concepts in Python by implementing a system that tracks books in a library, focusing on classes, object instantiation, and method invocation.

Your Task: library_management.py
Implement a Book class with public attributes title and author, and a private attribute _is_checked_out to track its availability.
Implement a Library class with a private list _books to store instances of Book. Include methods to add_book, check_out_book(title), return_book(title), and list_available_books.
Provided for Testing: main.py
This script demonstrates how to interact with your Book and Library classes.

from library_management import Book, Library

def main():
    # Setup a small library
    library = Library()
    library.add_book(Book("Brave New World", "Aldous Huxley"))
    library.add_book(Book("1984", "George Orwell"))

    # Initial list of available books
    print("Available books after setup:")
    library.list_available_books()

    # Simulate checking out a book
    library.check_out_book("1984")
    print("\nAvailable books after checking out '1984':")
    library.list_available_books()

    # Simulate returning a book
    library.return_book("1984")
    print("\nAvailable books after returning '1984':")
    library.list_available_books()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
